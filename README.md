# The Dax Problem
Presented by Daniel Bernstein

## Informal Statement
Suppose each of n people are randomly assigned a rank 1 through n (assume
a uniform distribution). Do this twice in a row and take the average rank
for each person. What are the chances that you end up with two people who
have the same average rank?

## More formal
See `dax_problem.jpg`

## Simulation
`python3 dax_problem.py` will run it once for a given value of `n`, with
lots of accompanying details so you can check my work.

`python3 dax_problem_iterative.py` will run it multiple times for values
of `n` so you can try to find a pattern.
